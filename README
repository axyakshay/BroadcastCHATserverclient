This is a TCP Simple Broadcast Chat Server and Client.

It consists of 3 source files :

1. ChatServer.c
2. ChatClient.c
3. AttributeStruct.h
and a Makefile.

Steps to run the program
1)make 
2)The server should be started with the IP and port supplied on the command line
	./server server_ip server_port max_clients
3)The clients should be started with the IP and port supplied on the command line
	./client username server_ip server_port

The server starts on a particular port.
The client with username joins
Multiple clients can join (with different usernames) 
Message sent by one client is broadcasted to all other clients (but not to the client sending the message)
When a client leaves the chat, server is notified of the same, and it broadcasts it to other clients (we get to know if server and client is ONLINE or OFFLINE)
When the client is idle for more than 10 seconds, a IDLE message is displayed. 


1) ChatServer.c : This is the server file, after starting, server accepts multiple client connections with JOIN messages. On receiving a client connection, the server validates the user and accordingly sends an ACK Message if validation is succesful, and NAK if validation is not succesful. Further, when server receives a message from a client, it broadcasts the same to all other clients.

2) ChatClient.c : Connects to the server and contains functions for sending the join message, sending messages and receiving messages from other clients. 

3) AttributeStruct.h : Contains the structures such as HeaderSBCP, AttributeSBCP and MessageSBCP for representing the SBCP message format. 

BONUS Features Implimented:
1)ACK, NAK, ONLINE and OFFLINE
2)IDLE
